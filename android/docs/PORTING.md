# Porting Silent Storm to Android

This is the working map for the port: what is done, what is left, in what order,
and the traps found along the way. It is written for someone picking the work up,
not as a summary of what happened.

**On the Samsung Z Fold7 (2026-08-19):** the app boots, runs the boot harness
(now 45 checks incl. the DB object chain and the menu chain), loads `Complete/game.db` in ~0.5 s,
and goes to the **main menu**, which is now the real thing: the retail scene
(burning wreck, smoke and ember particles, misty terrain, the animated 'Man'),
logo, version, five buttons laid out on the template's text line, and a proper
cursor. Taps click (one tap: the cursor and the button arrive in the same
frame). CAMPAIGN → side selection (its own scene, NEXT/BACK) → hero screen
(six characters, BACK / CUSTOM CHARACTER / NEXT), OPTIONS opens the book UI.
Menu music plays through the AAudio mixer.

**The whole menu chain walks by touch**, down to character generation and the
face screen. Every screen on it needed work, and all of it was the same
underlying difference: **the retail UI containers are a revision ahead of this
source snapshot**, and the source does nothing about the mismatch — a control
it asks for and the data does not have comes back from `CLoader::GetControl`
as a zero-sized, style-0 stand-in with only a console line, so the button is
invisible, unclickable and silent, while a control the data has and the source
does not know about is drawn anyway. What that cost, screen by screen:

* **side selection** (container 353) has `axis`/`allies` hit areas but no
  next/cancel, and the retail screen showed which side you had picked through
  its template's script (`OnScriptNotify`), which this snapshot does not have.
  Both sides therefore looked identical whatever you tapped, and NEXT was
  enabled from the start but silently did nothing until a side was chosen.
  `CSideMenuUI` now has a `Draw` that holds the chosen side's label in its
  hover state and greys NEXT out until there is a choice.
* **hero selection** (container 354) is six bare hit areas over the 3D
  characters, named by the same missing script. Nothing distinguished a picked
  character from an unpicked one; the only sign a tap had registered was NEXT
  un-greying. The screen now carries a label under the row with the chosen
  character's name.
* **character generation** (container 345) had no way in or out: the container
  has every control the screen wants *except* `play` and `cancel`, so both were
  invisible stand-ins and the screen was a dead end. It also ships four
  `*_hilight` overlays from a later revision that this source never turns off;
  `stats_hilight` is an opaque white rectangle over (505,178)-(978,618) — the
  entire right-hand page — so every attribute and skill readout was hidden
  behind it. BACK/NEXT are laid out on the template's text line and the
  overlays are hidden at template load.
* **face generation** (container 361) *crashed the game on its first frame*,
  which is why nothing past the hero screen could be reached. It has three
  `voice1`/`voice2`/`voice3` buttons where this source expects one `voice`
  scroll; the `CScroll` built on the stand-in asked `GetUIWindow` for its thumb
  and got a stand-in `CSlider`, and a stand-in never received the
  `EVENT_TEMPLATELOADCOMPLETE` that sets *its* own `pSlider`, so
  `CSlider::Update` dereferenced null every frame. Fixed at the general level —
  `GetUIWindow` now sends the stand-in that event (rule set 19) — and the voice
  scroll is no longer built at all when the template has no `voice` control.

Two platform bugs on the same path: a tap on the black border around the
letterboxed 1024x768 image pressed the mouse button at the cursor's *previous*
position, so tapping the ~40% of a 2520x1080 screen that is border clicked
whatever the cursor happened to be over; and `configChanges` did not list
`smallestScreenSize`, so folding or unfolding the device destroyed the
NativeActivity and re-ran the whole boot — mount, `game.db`, harness — from
scratch.

Known gaps on this path, both cosmetic: the voice selector is not merely
unwired but unimplemented in this snapshot — `CFaceGenUI::nVoice` is set and
read by nothing, and `NRPG::CreateMerc( pPers, pHead, bHero )` takes no voice
at all, so the unit's voice comes from its `CRPGPers` record. (The branch that
was meant to read it tested `szID == "face"` twice, so it has been dead since
2003; the id is corrected, the value still goes nowhere.) And a screen that
takes more than five seconds to load will raise an ANR if it is tapped while
loading: the input queue is attached to the game thread's looper by
`native_app_glue`, so nothing drains it while a load is in progress.

**A mission runs.** `template 4414` via `A5_START_CFG` now loads and plays: the
tactical HUD (Menu / Leave / Objectives / Journal, the party bar, the selected
soldier's weapon and ammo, START COMBAT), terrain and vegetation, and the
soldiers standing in their idle pose with the selection ring under them.
Steady frames, ~2,200 draws per five seconds. Two bugs stood between the menu
and this, and the second of them was affecting far more than missions:

* `NAI::CPathNetwork::GetDeployPlace` spreads a party ±1 tile around its deploy
  spot with no bounds check. This map's deploy spot resolves to grid row 0, so
  `y - 1` wrapped in `SPathPlace`'s 8-bit field to 255; `SPathPlace::IsValid()`
  only checks the *layer*, so the off-grid place travelled all the way to
  `CPathNetwork::GetCP`, which indexed `squareLevel[255/16][..]` on a 4×4 array
  and crashed. The same file's `GetLockAreaInternal` has exactly the bounds
  check `GetDeployPlace` is missing, so this is an original-engine oversight,
  not a 64-bit artefact. Clamped (rule set 18).
* **`NDb::BuildMapLinks()` was never called.** It walks the Animations table
  after the import and hangs each animation on its skeleton (and wires debris
  materials, item models to uniforms, and more). Every skeleton had an empty
  animation map, so every unit was created with no pose at all and the first
  `CUnitAnimator::StandStill` dereferenced the null it got back. See Traps.

A third bug showed up once the mission was reachable and is fixed too: the
party deployed on the map's edge and the camera opened over the void beyond it
— a black screen with the HUD on top, which looks exactly like a hang. See
"A deploy spot was resolved by scan order" in Traps.

Still open here: the retail scripts hit one `nil` function this snapshot's
script API lacks, and the tactical HUD draws a blue checkerboard where
`Textures/615` should be — that file is absent from the retail data.

**Mission frame rate and the loading screen (2026-08-25, rule sets 21/22).**
Both were places where this snapshot predates retail behaviour, and both fixes
were decoded from the retail Game.exe by the [Silent-Storm-Reconstruction
project](https://github.com/met-nikita/Silent-Storm-Reconstruction) (RVAs are
cited in the rules and in-code):

* **The HUD rebuilt the 3D portraits from scratch every frame.** Every
  `CUnitFace` — the big selected-unit face and the up-to-six party faces —
  called `CUnitView::SetUnit` from its panel's `Draw`, and that calls
  `NRender::CreateShowUnit`, a complete render clone of the unit (body model,
  uniform, head, animator). Seven full unit builds per frame. Retail
  `CUnitFace::SetUnit` (@0x254c80) is a no-op while the tracked unit is
  unchanged — rule set 21 does the same (and also compares the world unit, so
  a unit swapped under its tracker — entering a Panzerklein — still rebinds).
  The Panzerklein cannon slot had the same shape of bug: `CShowItemModel::Set`
  (a full `CreateModel` + a `new CToolTip`) per frame; retail keeps a
  weapon-in-hand cache (@0x256160).
* **Camera movement switched occlusion culling off.** `UpdateIgnoreMark`
  dropped the hidden-parts list on *any* camera motion and only rebuilt it
  after three still frames — so precisely while the player pans or zooms (on a
  touch screen: most of the time) the scene drew with no HSR at all. Retail's
  default mode (`gfx_hsr 2` = `HSR_DYNAMIC`, @0x160780) keeps the list alive
  while the camera moves and refreshes it every 2nd frame with a persistent
  400×300 rasteriser (`MakeInvisibleElementsListFast`, @0x1770f0); the
  full-resolution pass also gets retail's [4,400]×[4,300] clamp (@0x176d50).
  The whole retail mode is ported (enum value, `gfx_hsr` mapping and default,
  the fast pass, the mode-aware `UpdateIgnoreMark`).
* **A mission load was a black screen.** The snapshot's `ShowLogo()` draws one
  static frame of texture 1744 — absent from the retail data — and nothing
  else until the mission's first real frame. Retail's loading screen
  (`iLoading.obj`: `CLoadingUI` on UI container 419 — full-screen `background`
  splash, default UITexture 883, a bottom-right `video` box that played
  `loading.bik`, two template-drawn text lines — plus
  `ShowLoadingScreen(percent)` checkpoints) is recreated in `iMain.cpp` on
  this snapshot's own UI classes. Bink is not licensed here, so the video box
  holds a plain colour-fill progress bar. Checkpoints at 0 (with the zone's
  `PWLImageID` splash — the column is imported now, though every zone in the
  Steam `Complete/` data has it 0), 25, 50, 75, 100 in
  `CICBeginMission::Exec`/`CMission::Initialize`; `TermLoadingScreen` pairs
  with `DoneInterface`. The interface is built lazily on first use and kept
  for later loads. Note the 25→50 band (world generation) is the long one and
  the bar sits still inside it — the retail smooth counter that ticked inside
  world creation is not wired.

On-device state of this work (Z Fold7, 2026-08-25 evening): the build boots
(45/45 harness checks — container 419 is now one of them), `template 4414`
loads, and during the ~50 s load the loop presents frames again (the loading
screen's throttled flips — 4 presents in the last 5 s window of the load, 93
`vsRender2D` draws). What stopped the session was not the load but what comes
*after* it: once the mission is up, the engine spends **minutes at 100% CPU on
the game thread building collision BSP trees** (`Created BSP tree ...` flood —
the AI pass calcer / physics working through the map), presenting nothing.
A touch during that grind raised `Input dispatching timed out (Waited 10000ms
for MotionEvent)` **despite the input thread** — three ANRs and the system
killed the app before a steady-state FPS number could be read. So the
remaining mission-FPS work is this grind, not the render loop: (a) find out
why a MotionEvent still waits on the app (the input-thread reattach may be
losing to a queue created while the game thread is busy), and (b) time-slice
or background the pass-calc jobs (`aiPassCalcJob.cpp`) the way retail's
`PassCalcerIsActive` script polling implies they were. The per-frame fixes
above (portraits, HSR) apply to the loop that runs once the grind is over.

**Android 30 FPS work (2026-10-06, rule set 23).** On the connected Galaxy Z
Fold7 (Android 16, Adreno 830), `simpleperf` identified repeated BSP construction
as the loading/pass-calculation bottleneck. Clang with `-fms-extensions` honours
the old `#pragma optimize("", off)` switches: the supposedly optimised build
contained `optnone` BSP routines. Rule set 23 removes those switches and builds
missing BSPs once per static/memory geometry revision, retaining stored trees.
Skinned poses and the specialised terrain builder are unchanged. In the same
`template 4414` test, the long loading step fell from 47.8 s to 5.1 s.

The loop now selects vsyncs for a 30 FPS target, blocks while inactive, and logs
actual frame intervals. GLES 3 is requested explicitly. A pbuffer preserves the
context when the window is replaced, and the console no longer draws over a
running game's GL state. True GPU context loss still needs a separate recovery
path. The input worker is now started, acknowledges Android events promptly,
and queues copies for the game thread. A staged native-app-glue hook switches
queues before Android can destroy the old queue; it does not patch the SDK.

**Renderer optimisation is still under validation.** After the BSP fix the
paused mission was approximately 3.6–4 FPS: Adreno spent most of the frame in
full-buffer copies/allocation for small HUD updates. Mapped range uploads reached
about 30 FPS, but early variants corrupted the scene despite passing small
shader tests. They are not an accepted gameplay result. The current candidate
tracks referenced vertex/index ranges, conservatively retains outstanding
regions after a partial synchronized map, and validates index bounds. It is
opt-in with `A5_D3D_BUFFER_MAP=1` in `env.txt`; the default retains the original
upload path until the mission passes a sustained visual/input/resume check.
Do not remove the opt-in gate based solely on FPS or the boot harness.

The expanded device harness passes 48 checks (including appends to a 16 MiB
vertex pool, overlapping updates, and missing-program rejection), with two
existing data/UI warnings. Host checks pass (38 checks plus CTest's frame
schedule and BSP-cache regressions). ARM64 full-game and ARMv7 harness builds
compile. Final scene validation of the latest candidate was interrupted when
Android returned to the PIN screen; unpaused gameplay and background/return
remain to be checked on the unlocked device.

Three bugs found on the way that were invisible before and affect *everything*
(details in Traps): DB cross-references imported from a file where the target
class was only forward-declared were all null (Itanium `typeid(T*)` for an
incomplete `T` never compares equal — every map was empty); loose-file
resources did not "exist" for `CResourceFileOpener::DoesExist` (every model
part skipped); particle effect records carry 32-bit offsets in pointer fields.

Debug switches (in `<external files>/env.txt`, `NAME=VALUE` per line):
`A5_D3D_TRACE=<frames>` logs every draw and a back-buffer histogram,
`A5_D3D_FORCE=nocull,nodepth,noblend` overrides state, `A5_DB_DUMP=1` /
`A5_DB_DUMP_ROWS=<table>` dump the database, `A5_UI_DUMP=1` lists the menu
UI containers control by control, `A5_AUDIO_TRACE=1` logs every
sound/stream start (the 5-s `audio:` stats line — voices, streams, output
peak, underruns — is always on), `A5_START_CFG=<cfg>` runs that cfg instead of
`start.cfg` (e.g. a file with `template 4414` to drop into a mission). The
engine console is echoed to logcat as `console: ...`.

## The order the remaining work should happen in

### 1. `wstring` — done

The engine serialises `std::wstring` straight into `game.db` and asset files,
and it is UTF-16 because `wchar_t` is 2 bytes on Win32. Android's is 4. The
staged sources now use `char16_t`/`std::u16string` (a mechanical pass in
`prepare_sources.py`), `WCHAR` is `char16_t` in the compat `windows.h`, and
`compat/src/wide_char.cpp` provides the char16_t CRT forms plus real
windows-1251/1252 conversion tables for `MultiByteToWideChar` and friends.

### 1b. `game.db` — done, by importing the retail format

No `game.db` in this repository is in the layout this source's `ADOFake` stub
expects (typed records serialised through their own `operator&`). Every shipped
file (`Data/`, `Complete/`, `Versions/Current/*/`) stores each table as an object
of a class registered as `0xA1843130` — a **generic column store**, i.e. a dump of
the ADO table the content team edited:

```
chunk 2   per record: vector<int>       int and bool columns, in column order
chunk 3   per record: vector<float>     float columns
chunk 4   per record: vector<wstring>   string columns (UTF-16)
chunk 5   column descriptors { 2: name (windows-1251), 3: type 0 int/1 bool/2 float/3 string }
chunk 6/7/8   names of the int / float / string columns, in value order
```

The table ids in the file's top-level `hash_map<int, CObj<CObjectBase>>` are the
same ids `DBFormat` registers (`45` = Strings, `0xE0000001` = RPGWeaponTypes…),
which is what makes the import possible: the shipping engine evidently ran the
ADO-style import at load time against that dump, and so does the port.
`platform/db_retail.cpp` (built instead of `ADOFake/BasicDBfake.cpp`) is the
`ADOImport/BasicDB.cpp` driver — PreCreate every table's records by their `ID`
column, then call each record's own `Import()` with the table cursor on its
row — with the chunk format as the "connection". The record classes' `Import()`
methods, which is where the schema lives, run unchanged.

Result on `Complete/game.db` (34 MB): 130/130 tables matched, 222,619 records,
14 columns the source asks for that the file no longer has (`RPGWeapons.
AmmoTypeID`, `MaleCustomHead1..6`… — the fields stay default), 25 tables in the
file this source has no class for (later features: medals, chests, hair/glasses
customisation). `Data/game.db` (3 MB) is a development cut of the same format
with too little data to be consistent (one weapon type) — use `Complete/`'s.
`A5_DB_DUMP=1` in the environment logs every table's columns.

Two details that matter: column names in the file are windows-1251 bytes and the
staged sources are UTF-8, and one source column name really does contain a
Cyrillic letter (`DamageMоd`); the loader converts. Relation tables
(`RPGPers2Scripts`) are not in the file, so `ImportRelation` returns empty lists.

### 2. `Image` — done

BMP/TGA/PNG/MMP loading builds and runs; libpng 1.0.9 is built from the tree
against the NDK's zlib with the x86 assembler back ends off. `ImagePack.cpp` (the
DXT *encoder* on a proprietary `s3tc.h`) is a tools-side dependency of TexConv
and is not part of the runtime. `platform/dxt_decode.cpp` decodes DXT1/3/5 in
software for GPUs without `GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc` and for the harness,
which checks decoded mean colour against the header's `dwAverageColor`.

### 3. `Main` — done: 269/269 files build, link and run

Getting there was almost entirely a matter of MSVC 7 leniencies handled once, as
mechanical passes or rules in `prepare_sources.py` — see "Traps" below for the
list. Every remaining piece of x86 inline assembly is gone: the MMX skinning in
`GCombiner.cpp` (verified against float within 0.01), the particle colour
modulate (bit-exact against an emulation of the instruction sequence), the
bilinear resample and the 2D blend in the software paths, the MMX AABB
accumulator, and the MMX `ReallyFastShiftingTransfer` in the vertex-buffer path.

The Direct3D 9 backend (`Gfx.cpp`, `GfxBuffers.cpp`, `GfxRender.cpp`,
`GfxEffects.cpp`, `GfxShaders.cpp` — ~6,500 lines) is **kept as written** and
runs on a Direct3D 9 implementation over GLES 3.0:
`compat/d3d9gles/d3d9.h` + `d3d9gles.cpp` (~2,000 lines). The full contract that
implementation honours — the ~40 device methods, the three vertex formats, the
constant-register map, the render-target model, the coordinate-system
differences — is [RENDERER.md](RENDERER.md). In short:

* framebuffer memory is always in D3D layout (row 0 at the top); every draw goes
  into an FBO with a y-flip in the vertex shader (`posFixup`), which mirrors the
  winding — D3D measures it in projected space, y up, like GL — so `D3DCULL_CW`
  becomes `glFrontFace(GL_CW)` + cull back (the *un*-mirrored mapping would be
  `GL_CCW`; getting this backwards culled every 2D quad); `Present` is a flipped
  `glBlitFramebuffer` into the EGL surface, letterboxed to the requested mode
  (1024×768 by default)
* the 155 D3D shader-assembly programs the engine embeds (`GfxShadersDescr.h`)
  are recovered by `tools/extract_shaders.py` and translated to GLSL ES 3.00 by
  `tools/d3dasm2glsl.py`; the runtime finds a program by the FNV-1a hash of the
  assembly text (`shaders/glsl_table.cpp`) and links per (vs, ps, cube-sampler
  mask). All 155 compile and draw on the Adreno 830 (`platform/d3d_selftest.cpp`)
* textures keep a CPU shadow so `LockRect` works; DXT goes to the GPU when
  `GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc` is there and through `platform/dxt_decode.cpp`
  otherwise; vertex/index buffers keep a shadow with dirty ranges (`MarkDirty`,
  hinted from the engine's own lock calls by a staging rule) so the 32-bit
  index streaming path costs one upload per lock

`platform/game_entry.cpp` is `Game/Main.cpp`'s WinMain in three calls
(`a5_game_init` / `a5_game_step` / `a5_game_shutdown`), driven by
`android_main.cpp` once the boot harness passes and data is mounted.

### 4. Input, audio, video

* **Input**: `Input/Input.h` is the seam — a clean, DirectInput-free interface
  (`InitInput`, `PumpMessages`, `GetMessage(SMessage*)`, `GetControlID`).
  `platform/input_android.cpp` implements it: a control table with the original
  control names mapped to Android key codes, mouse buttons and wheel; touches
  become an absolute pointer position (`a5_set_pointer_position`) that
  `Cursor.cpp` reads in preference to integrated deltas (staging rule).
  `Bind.cpp` (action mapping) is portable and sits on top. Camera gestures ride
  the retail binds (`cfg/input.cfg`): a two-finger **pinch** is the mouse wheel
  (`-camera_zoom 'MOUSE_AXIS_Z'`), a two-finger **drag** holds `MOUSE_BUTTON2`
  and feeds `MOUSE_AXIS_X/Y` deltas — the PC middle-button pan
  (`+camera_forward` / `-camera_strafe`) — and a two-finger **tap** is still the
  right click. Rotation rides the right-button binds: a two-finger **twist**
  (the finger line turning >10° before the drag slop trips) holds
  `MOUSE_BUTTON1` and feeds `MOUSE_AXIS_X` (`-camera_rotate`), and a
  **three-finger drag** is the whole PC right-button drag — horizontal rotates,
  vertical tilts (`-camera_pitch`). A gesture is one mode for its whole life
  (pan/zoom, twist, or orbit) because pan holds button 2 and rotation holds
  button 1, and with both held one axis message would drive both camera binds.
  So a starting pinch never lands as a phantom left click, a single finger's
  press is held back ~90 ms (or until it moves/lifts) before it reaches the
  engine.
* **Audio** — done for what can be exercised so far. `FModSound/FMsound.h` is
  the seam (Main only ever calls `NFMSound::*`); `platform/audio_android.cpp`
  implements it on a software mixer of its own: 64 sample voices + streams,
  float mixing at the device rate with linear resampling, on a mixer thread
  that writes to **AAudio** with blocking writes (AAudio is `dlopen`ed so
  minSdk stays 24; without it the mixer runs against a clock, silently).
  Semantics follow the FMOD wrapper: dropping the last `CObj<>` to a
  `CSound2D/3D` stops the voice; 3D positions go through the listener's
  projection matrix (`|(2x, 2y, w)|` in clip space) with FMOD's logarithmic
  rolloff between the sample's min/max distance; volumes are 0..255, SFX
  master scales voices, music volume is absolute per stream; a stream's
  `IsPlaying()` goes false when it ends, which is what makes `CSoundScene`
  restart the ambient after 120 s. One deliberate divergence: `PlayStream()`
  hands back the stream that is already playing the same file instead of
  layering a second copy — every pushed menu interface creates its own sound
  scene and starts the ambient on its first `Draw()`.
  Decoders (`platform/audio_decode.cpp`, no engine dependency): the retail
  `Sounds/<id>` files are Ogg Vorbis (6910, encoded with libVorbis 1.0
  beta3/RC1 — **floor type 0**, which stb_vorbis/minivorbis cannot decode, so
  the Xiph reference libogg+libvorbis are vendored under `thirdparty/`) and
  RIFF WAVE (1300 Microsoft ADPCM, 80 IMA ADPCM, 204 PCM); music
  `Res\Music\*.wav` is Ogg Vorbis inside. `build/host/silentstorm_audiotest`
  decodes every file and compares the WAVs sample-for-sample with ffmpeg:
  1584/1584 bit-exact, 6940/6940 Ogg decode to their declared length. Music
  is needed on the device: `Versions/Current/res/Music/*.wav` → `<data
  root>/res/Music/` (`push_data.sh --full` covers `Sounds/`, not this).
  On the Z Fold7 the main-menu track streams at 48 kHz with 0 underruns.
  Not yet exercised: 3D voices and sample fades. A mission now loads, so
  they are reachable — that is the next thing to listen to.
  Open: OpenSL ES for API 24/25 (silent there today), the app's audio focus.
* **Video**: Bink is licensed and absent. Cutscenes should be skipped or the
  container replaced; nothing else depends on it.
* **LifeStudio:HEAD** (facial animation for dialogue heads, proprietary) is
  stubbed under `compat/include/thirdparty-stubs/`: heads render in their neutral
  pose. Reviving it means licensing the SDK or writing a macro-muscle deformer.

### 5. The game layer

Everything else in `Main` — scene graph, animation, pathfinding, AI, UI, RPG and
turn logic — is platform-independent C++ and should mostly compile once the
compat layer covers it. Budget the effort for the renderer, not for this.

## Traps found so far

Things that cost time here, so they do not cost it again:

**32-bit pointer assumptions.** The stream layer stores a logical EOF as a
pointer past the end of its buffer and adjusts it with unsigned arithmetic that
relied on 32-bit wraparound. It crashes instantly on arm64 rather than
misbehaving subtly — but the same pattern may exist elsewhere in code that has
not been exercised yet. Grep for pointer arithmetic mixing `unsigned int` offsets.

**`Float2Int` rounds.** 238 call sites. The x87 original uses the current FPU
rounding mode (nearest-even); `(int)` truncates. Use `lrintf`.

**`hash_map` iteration order.** The port maps STLport's `hash_map` onto
`std::unordered_map`. Reading is unaffected, but anything that *writes* a
container to disk will produce a different entry order than the 2003 tools did.
That is fine for `.res` packages (they carry a lookup table) — check before
relying on it for save games.

**Object references in the chunk serialiser are 32-bit save-time addresses.**
`CStructureSaver` writes 4 bytes of an object's *pointer* as its reference ID and
maps them back on load. On 64-bit that dropped half the address on write and
left half a `void*` unwritten on read, so every reference resolved to nothing.
The port keys references as `uint32` throughout and, on write, numbers stored
objects densely instead of using addresses. On-disk format is unchanged.

**MSVC 7 leniencies that recur across the tree** — all handled by mechanical
passes in `prepare_sources.py`, so they will not need attention again in `Main`:
forward-declared enums (`enum E;` → `enum E : int;` plus the definition),
`typename` on dependent iterator types, `if ( CDynamicCast<T> p( x ) )`
declarations, `typeid` on incomplete types in the class factory, and the
`CPtr<T> == T*` overload ambiguity.

**RTTI: MSVC lets you `dynamic_cast` from the wrong subobject; Itanium does
not.** The engine casts opaque pointers to `(CObjectBase*)` — forward-declared
`NGfx::CTexture*`, `void*` command contexts — and then `dynamic_cast`s. That is a
reinterpret_cast; MSVC's RTTI still finds the complete object from whatever vptr
is at that address, libc++abi looks for a `CObjectBase` subobject there, finds
none (it is a *virtual* base, at the end of the object) and returns null.
Symptom: every `CDynamicCast<I2DBuffer>( pTexture )` null, first texture load
crashes. `compat/src/rtti_compat.cpp` (`a5_cast_opaque<T>()`) does what MSVC did
— vptr → complete object and its `type_info` → walk the ABI's base-class
descriptors to the destination — and `CDynamicCast` and the `pContext` sites go
through it (staging rules). Any *new* `(CObjectBase*)something` cast is suspect.

**`LONG` is 32 bits.** The engine casts `CTRect<int>*` to `RECT*` and
`CTPoint<int>*` to `POINT*` when calling D3D (`GfxBuffers.cpp`'s texture
locker). With `typedef long LONG` on LP64 those structs double in size and the
lock rectangle reads garbage — a write 2^50 bytes past the texture. The compat
`windows.h` now types `LONG` as `int`, as Win32 does.

**`typeid(T*)` for an incomplete `T` compares equal to nothing.** The Itanium
ABI gives such a type_info internal linkage and a name starting with `*`
("compare by address"), so a lookup keyed by `typeid(NDb::CX*)` taken in a file
that only forward-declares `CX` never finds the entry registered where `CX` is
complete. The class factory's pointer-typed table index (used by every
`ImportField( name, CPtr<T>* )`) now compares mangled names with the `*`
stripped (`BasicFactory.h` rule). Symptom before: whole maps without objects
and no error anywhere.

**`CResourceFileOpener::DoesExist` only knew packages.** Outside `_MAPEDIT` it
returned false for anything not in a `.res`; the retail data ships
`Geometries/`, `AIGeometries/` as loose files, so every model part was silently
skipped. Rule set 17 falls back to a stat of the loose file.

**File images with 32-bit pointers.** Particle effects (`GParticleFormat`) are
loaded as a memory image whose records hold file offsets in pointer-typed
fields, fixed up in place. On LP64 the record is a different size; the loader
now decodes the file records into native structs. Grep for `pData + (int)`
patterns before trusting any other blob loader.

**`lua_dobuffer` does not run the chunk.** It parses and *starts* it on a Lua
thread; `lua_executeThreads()` is commented out in `ldo.cpp` because the engine
pumps threads from its frame loop. Call `Script::ExecuteThreads()` or nothing
happens and no error is reported.

**Links that are not columns have to be rebuilt after the import.**
`NDb::BuildMapLinks()` walks the imported tables and hangs each record on the
one it belongs to: every `Animations` row onto its skeleton's `pAnimations`,
every `Debris` row onto its material, item models onto uniforms. This
snapshot's own `Main.cpp` never calls it, because the `game.db` it was written
against came out of `DataImport`, which called `BuildMapLinks()` itself and
then serialised the records *with the links already in them*. The retail
`game.db` is the generic column dump (see 1b), so nothing rebuilds them — and
the later `Soft/Andy/May03/Main.cpp` shows what the shipping game did:
`NDatabase::Import( true )` immediately followed by `NDb::BuildMapLinks()`.
The port does that at the end of `NDatabase::Serialize`
(`platform/db_retail.cpp`). Symptom before: every skeleton's animation map
empty, so `CSkeleton::GetAnimation` returned null for every unit and the first
`CUnitAnimator::StandStill` in a mission wrote through it. Nothing logged.
The harness now checks it (119/124 skeletons carry animations, 2,045 in all).
**Any other function in `DBFormat`/`Main` with no caller in the port is
suspect for the same reason** — grep before assuming the data is at fault.

**65 of the 3,672 `Terrain/` files use an older record layout.**
`CMETerrainInfo::operator&` reads the terrain through `f.Add( 21, &info )`,
and 3,607 files do store it nested in chunk 21. The other 65 (18 of them
substantial — `Terrain/202` holds a real 257×257 heightmap) store
`STerrainInfo`'s fields at the record's *top* level, the way an earlier
`CMETerrainInfo` wrote them. `Add` finds no chunk 21, returns without a word,
and `info` stays default: flat terrain, no type map. Not yet hit by any map
that has been loaded, but it is waiting. The chunk format is easy to read
offline if you need to check a file — `<id:1><len><payload>`, where `len` is
one byte `>> 1` unless bit 0 is set, in which case it is a little-endian dword
`>> 1`, and chunks nest inside payloads.

**A deploy spot was resolved by scan order, not by distance.**
`CWorld::AddPlayer` finds the grid place for a deploy spot with
`GetNearPlaces( SSphere( ptPos, fR ) )`, growing `fR` from 0.63 until the
result is non-empty, and then takes `res[0]`. `AddNearPoints` fills that
vector by scanning the layer in increasing y, so `res[0]` is the lowest-y tile
in the sphere, not the closest one. On `template 4414` the spot's authored z
is 1.49 m above ground that really is flat at 0 (verified against the retail
`Terrain/8006`, which ships an all-zero heightmap), so the 3D distance test
fails until `fR` reaches 2.52 — by which point the sphere touches the map's
bottom edge and row 0 wins. That is what put the party on the edge of the map,
and it is what made the `GetDeployPlace` wrap reachable. Fixed (rule set 20):
among the places on the lowest floor, take the one nearest the spot. The
"Deploy spot" line now says which place a spot resolved to and how far that is
from it — on `template 4414` the four spots land 0.05–0.33 m from their marks,
where spot 0 used to land 1.74 m away and off the terrain.

**The retail UI containers are a revision ahead of this source, and nothing
says so.** `CLoader::GetControl` answers a request for a control the container
does not have with a zero-sized, style-0 `SWindowInfo` and one line on the
console — so the code goes on to build a button that is invisible, unclickable
and silent, and the screen looks finished while a button does nothing. In the
other direction, controls the data has and the source does not know about are
created and drawn by the loader anyway, which is how an opaque `stats_hilight`
came to sit over half of character generation. Every menu screen in the game
was affected in one direction or the other. Two things follow: use
`HasControl()` and lay a stand-in out yourself rather than trusting
`GetControl`, and dump the container before believing a screen is complete —
`A5_UI_DUMP=1` on the host harness lists every control of the menu containers
with its id, type, rectangle, depth, colour and texture count. The nastiest
form of this is a stand-in that other code then queries: a stand-in is created
outside `CLoader`, so before rule set 19 it never got
`EVENT_TEMPLATELOADCOMPLETE` and any child pointer it resolves in that handler
stayed null — which is what killed the face screen every frame.

**The shipped `.res` files are one revision newer than this source snapshot.**
Signature `0x96948A22`, not the `0x95938921` in `FilesPackage.cpp`. The chunk
format itself is unchanged. `Complete/regs.res` is not a package at all despite
the extension.

**Directories pushed with `adb push` are owned by `shell` with mode 0770** and
the app cannot enter them. `scripts/push_data.sh` chmods the tree afterwards.

## Things deliberately not done

* **`MemoryMngr`** replaces global `operator new`/`delete` and walks the PE
  import table for symbol names. Drop it; keep `DumbPow2Alloc` only if profiling
  says the system allocator is a problem.
* **`ADOImport`** is COM/ADO against SQL Server, used at content-build time. Its
  *driver* logic is what `platform/db_retail.cpp` re-creates over the retail
  `game.db`; the COM part is never built.
* **`MapEdit`** (362 files) is MFC. It is a desktop tool, not part of the game.
* **The `.def` files.** Each module was a DLL exporting mangled C++ symbols. On
  Android everything links into one `.so`; `externA5` becomes plain `extern`.

## Testing

`platform/boot_harness.cpp` drives the ported subsystems against real game data
and is the port's regression test. It runs in two places from the same source:

* on device, rendered by the GLES console and logged to `adb logcat -s SilentStorm`
* on the host, headless: `build/host/silentstorm_hosttest <game-data-dir>`,
  exit code 0 when everything passes

Add a check there whenever a subsystem starts working. Past the harness, the
game itself runs on device only (it needs the GLES device): `scripts/build.sh
arm64-v8a && scripts/build_apk.sh arm64-v8a && scripts/run.sh`, then
`adb logcat -s SilentStorm` — the loop logs `perf:` with FPS, frame-interval
percentiles, work/swap time, skipped draws and GL errors every five seconds.
`build_apk.sh` now rebuilds native libraries before packaging; `A5_SKIP_BUILD=1`
is an explicit opt-out for a build that has just completed. The host target builds in
seconds and is debuggable with lldb, which is how the 64-bit stream bug above was
found — do not debug engine logic on a device if the host can reproduce it.
